# RazorPad
Very simple 8 keys, with 5 way navigation switch, bluetooth controller intended to work with Drive Mode Dashboard 2, Osmand or similar navigation apps

BE AWARE!!! I'm not a programmer nor a skilled maker, i just don't want to spend 150 or more euros for commercial controller (that is surely better engineered, water resistant, FW mainteined, etc, etc) so i gathered info around other free project and mixed them on something functional FOR ME.

The code is actually intended for a standard ESP32 Dev Module (I use a C3 super mini, Lolin mini and Lolin pico mini ESP32)

The project is actually built with the last ESP32 BleKeyboard 0.3.2-beta from https://github.com/T-vK/ESP32-BLE-Keyboard/releases

Some of the inspiration come from:
- https://github.com/StylesRallyIndustries/RallyController
- https://jaxeadv.com/barbuttons
- https://github.com/MartinRV84
- - and others around the net i'm surely fotgoyying
